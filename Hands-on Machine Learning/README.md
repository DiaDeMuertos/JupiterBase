# Hands-on Machine Learning

## NOTES

- **Dimensionality reduction**:
  in which the goal is to simplify the data
  without losing too much information.
- **Anomaly detection**
- **Association rule learning**:in which the
  goal is to dig into large amounts of data and discover interesting relations between
  attributes.
- **No Free Lunch Theorem**: David Wolpert demonstrated that if you make absolutely
  no assumption about the data, then there is no reason to prefer one model over any
  other. The only way to know for sure which model is best is to evaluate them all. Since this is not
  possible, in practice you make some reasonable assumptions about the data and you
  evaluate only a few reasonable models.
